# unit-4-game

LEGO Batman RPG game. Utilized HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery, and a little bit of luck!

Four characters are available from the start of the game, Batman, Robin, The Joker or Catwoman.  Choose wisely! Select a character and get into the fight.  Then you may choose your first enemy to fight.  Select the attack button to attack your selected enemy.  If you defeat your enemy, select another enemy to fight until you have beat all enemies.  If you do not defeat your enemy, try the game over again and fight harder next time!!!

Once you have defeated all your enemies, you have won!!  Good job!  If you chose Batman or Robin, you quite possibly saved Gotham City from certain doom.  If you chose The Joker or Catwoman, I doubt that there will be a Gotham City to go back to...thanks a lot...
